Divide package objects into their own file - package definitions file and package object file are separate. Upon starting manager, the package object files are loaded. Upon starting an adventure, the package definitions files needed are loaded based on the package object files and their children 
Install-package command modifies tree that specifies the definitions files that will be loaded upon start-adventure
Start-adventure will create a new environment, load the definitions files into that environment, and switch the repl to that game environment

;;; Methods to examine current adventure
;; list packages

;; list places

;; list rules

;; list object-types


;;; Methods to add to world

#| ## TODO ##
Things we need to make this work
a) analyzer (above)
b) (use-package <name>) syntax in loadspec
|#


;;; Methods to remove from world

#| ## TODO ##
a) remove-handler message for generic
    (override the common/generics file?
b) update package listing and checking dependencies
